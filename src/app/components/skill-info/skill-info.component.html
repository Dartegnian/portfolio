		<p>Ever since its inception, the World Wide Web has served as a fundemental mold that brings technologies and infrastructures together. I first started editing HTML templates for my blog and website.</p>
		<p>As a developer, I want to tap in to the ever-changing landscape and grow more in the field. It's very interesting to me to have the opportunity to develop software that works on a myriad of device types. Ever since getting into web development in 2019, I've expanded into the role of an IT senior developer as of writing.</p>
